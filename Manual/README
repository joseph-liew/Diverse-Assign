# HOW TO USE THE PROGRAMME
Steps:
(1)	Save the CSV file to the same folder as this programme (“DiverseAssignv0.2.3a.exe”).
(2)	Open “DiverseAssignv0.2.3a.exe”
(3)	Follow the on-screen instructions.
(4)	Done!

The programme adds one column to the start (“left”) of the CSV file and one column to the end (“right”) of the CSV file. 

The first column added has no name. It is the index. In other words, it records the sequence of rows before the group assignment. 

(Note that the sequence starts from 0 and ascends down the row. For e.g. If there are 61 rows, ‘0’ is the first row. ‘60’ is the last row.) 

The last column is named “assigned_group”. This column indicates the assigned groups. The groups are numbered from 1 to the number of groups you wanted. E.g. If you wanted 10 groups, the rows are assigned ‘1’ to ‘10’.

If you would like a demo, copy and paste the sample file “sample_input.csv” from the “samples” folder to the same folder as the programme. 

The Aggregate Diversity Score should be close or similar to the “sample_output.csv” in the “samples” folder. The Aggregate Diversity Score of the sample output was 1.9946576237447953.

FAQ: 
====
Why are the solutions slightly different each time I run the same input and number of groups?

Ans:
==== 
-	Within a small range of similar diversity scores, there can be multiple solutions. 
-	Analogically, think of a square hole and a circle peg. If the square hole is slightly larger the circle, circle peg can fit through the square hole. 
-	Mathematically, it’s possible to have multiple solutions that share the same diversity. In a diverse problem, there are multiple combination of features and attributes that can combine to get the same diversity score.
-	Currently, the programme can achieve a diversity close to the maximum diversity possible. However, we are unable to achieve maximum diversity without the computer crunching the programme for hours.
-	Hence, the programme provides the best solution that is close to the optimum (or most diverse) score.
-	Optimisation to achieve maximum diversity is being explored. If you know how to engineer programmes and you’d like contribute, please contact us via our GitHub page at: https://github.com/joseph-liew/Diverse-Assign
