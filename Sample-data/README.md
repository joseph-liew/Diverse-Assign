A sample input data "sample_input.csv" and output "sample_output.csv" are included in this folder.
- Feel free to use the sample working data to experiment with the programme.
- Sample input data was generated using ["generatedata.com"](https://generatedata.com/). Credits to the team at [https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata) for creating this magnificent mock data generator.
- Sample output has an *Aggregate Diversity Score* of 1.9946576237447953.

FAQ: 
====
Why are the solutions slightly different each time I run the same input and number of groups?

Ans:
==== 
-	Within a small range of similar diversity scores, there can be multiple solutions. 
-	Analogically, think of a square hole and a circle peg. If the square hole is slightly larger the circle, circle peg can fit through the square hole. 
-	Mathematically, it’s possible to have multiple solutions that share the same diversity. In a diverse problem, there are multiple combination of features and attributes that can combine to get the same diversity score.
-	Currently, the programme can achieve a diversity close to the maximum diversity possible. However, we are unable to achieve maximum diversity without the computer crunching the programme for hours.
-	Hence, the programme provides the best solution that is close to the optimum (or most diverse) score.
-	Optimisation to achieve maximum diversity is being explored. If you know how to engineer programmes and you’d like contribute, please contact us via our GitHub page at: [https://github.com/joseph-liew/Diverse-Assign](https://github.com/joseph-liew/Diverse-Assign)
